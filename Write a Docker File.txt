Write a Docker File

As per recent requirements shared by the Nautilus application development team, they need custom
images created for one of their projects. Several of the initial testing requirements are 
already been shared with DevOps team. Therefore, create a docker file /opt/docker/Dockerfile 
(please keep D capital of Dockerfile) on App server 2 in Stratos DC and configure to build an image with the following requirements:

a. Use ubuntu as the base image.

b. Install apache2 and configure it to work on 6400 port. (do not update any other Apache configuration settings like document root etc).

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
RUN apt-get install apache2 -y
RUN sed -i "s/80/6400/g" /etc/apache2/ports.conf
EXPOSE 5003
CMD ["/usr/sbin/apache2ctl", "-D", "FOREGROUND", "-k", "start"]


First try to build an image using this Dockerfile using sudo docker build -t my_image .
You should see that the image gets built successfully with any errors
Next is try to run the image as sudo docker run --name my_srv -p 6400:6400 -d my_image (Change 5003 to the port asked in the question). It should run without any errors.
Lastly test using curl as curl http://localhost:6400. You should a HTML content returned from the container.
