Puppet Setup NTP Server

While troubleshooting one of the issue on app servers in Stratos Datacenter DevOps team 
identified the root cause that the time isn't synchronized properly among all app servers 
which cause issues sometimes. So team has decided to use a specific time server for 
all app servers so that they all remain in sync. This task needs to be done using 
Puppet so as per details mentioned below please compete the task:


Create a puppet programming file beta.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory 
on puppet master node i.e on Jump Server. Within the programming file define a custom class ntpconfig 
to install and configure ntp server on all app servers.

Also add NTP Server server 3.pool.ntp.org in default configuration file on all app servers.

Please note that do not try to start/restart/stop ntp service as we already have a scheduled restart for this service tonight and we don't want these changes to be applied right now.

Note: Please perform this task using beta.pp only, do not try to create any separate inventory file.





1. puppet module install puppetlabs-ntp

class { 'ntp':
servers => [ '3.pool.ntp.org' ],
}
class ntpconfig {
include ntp
}



node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {
  include ntpconfig
}
