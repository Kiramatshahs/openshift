Puppet Setup Local Yum Repos

Create a puppet programming file beta.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests 
directory on master node i.e on Jump Server. Define a class local_yum_repo and perform below mentioned tasks:

There are some RPMs already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Create a local yum repository named localyum (make sure to set Repository ID to localyum). Configure it to use 
packages location /packages/downloaded_rpms on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Install package vim-enhanced from this newly created repository through on all puppet agent nodes i.e on all App Servers.

Make sure to create a single puppet programming file beta.pp to configure local yum repository and install the package.

Note: Please perform this task using beta.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.



# Step 1: Save this file under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests 
#         as a file with the name specified in the question e.g. news.pp
# Step 2: Change the yum repo name, paths and application package according to question
# Step 3: Run the puppet verifications steps mentioned in puppet/README.md
# Step 4: Finally, SSH to each hosts and run `sudo puppet agent -tv` to make
#         sure you install the package
# Step 5: Verify: Check that the required package (e.g. httpd) is installed from local 
#         repo using 'repoquery -i httpd'
#         ('Repository' field should show as 'local_yum')
#         Note: You may have to install `yum-utils` for repoquery to work - 
#          'sudo yum install -y yum-utils'
#
