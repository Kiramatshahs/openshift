Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster. 
They recently decided to implement some new features in the application, and they want to maintain those 
new changes in a separate branch. Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:


On Storage server in Stratos DC create a new branch xfusioncorp_cluster 
from master branch in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster git repo.

Please do not try to make any changes in code.



connect to  ststore  server:

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System
Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.
    #2) Think before you type.
    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

[sudo] password for natasha:

go to  GIT repository
================

 [root@ststor01 ecommerce]# cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/ecommerce

 we are switched on kodekloud_ecommerce branch

 [root@ststor01 ecommerce]# git branch
* kodekloud_ecommerce
  master

  [root@ststor01 ecommerce]# ls
data.txt  info.txt

switch to master branch:
=====================
[root@ststor01 ecommerce]#   git checkout master

We are switched to 'master' branch:

 [root@ststor01 demo]# git branch
  kodekloud_ecommerce
* master

[root@ststor01 ecommerce# ls
info.txt

create a branch 'xfusioncorp_ecommerce'  from  master branch :
=======================================================
[root@ststor01 ecommerce]# git checkout -b xfusioncorp_ecommerce

Switched to a new branch 'xfusioncorp_ecommerce'

[root@ststor01 ecommerce]# ls
info.txt

[root@ststor01 ecommerce]# git branch
  kodekloud_ecommerce
  master
* xfusioncorp_commerce

[root@ststor01 ecommerce]# ls
info.txt

That's all !



Is says in the description that the new branch should be from the master branch. 
So first you need to go to the master branch with "git checkout master" and then 
do "git checkout -b xfusioncorp_ecommerce master". See if that work.


First perform "git checkout master" and then perform "git checkout -b xfusioncorp_ecommerce" , 
Click the checkbox on the left to retry.
You can also do "git branch xfusioncorp_ecommerce master" to create it from master. 
Otherwise, it will create from another branch which is currently checked out.
