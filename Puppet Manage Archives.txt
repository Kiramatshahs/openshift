The Nautilus DevOps team has zipped data on all app servers in Stratos DC that they want to 
extract to all app servers in the same data center. However, they want to extract that data 
in a different directory in the app servers. Perform the task using a Puppet programming file 
as per requirements mentioned below:


Create a puppet programming file games.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests 
on master node i.e on Jump Server. Using Puppet, archive resource and perform the tasks below:

There is a zip archive /usr/src/games/games.zip on all app servers. 
Unzip the archive to location /opt/games on each app server.

Note: Please perform this task using games.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.



node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp02.stratos.xfusioncorp.com', 'stapp03.stratos.xfusioncorp.com'
{     include mymodule
}

class mymodule {

archive { '/opt/games/games.zip':
ensure => present,
extract => true,
extract_path => '/opt/games',
source => '/usr/src/games/games.zip',
